# HTML-Projects
Simple HTML Webpage Project This project is a basic webpage built using HTML, demonstrating fundamental web development concepts such as structure, layout, links, and content organization. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to create and style a webpage using clean and semantic HTML code.

## Pages
- `calculator.html` - simple calculator demo
- `rock-paper.html` - rock-paper-scissors demo
- `cart-quantity.html` - demo for quantity controls
- `sudoku.html` - Sudoku interactive page (new feature)
- `snake/index.html` - Classic Snake game demo (new)

 Open these pages in a browser (or run a local HTTP server) to play with the demos.

Tips:
- Open `snake/index.html` in a browser (or open it via a local server: e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx http-server`) to play the new Snake demo.
